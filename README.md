# calculator
The good old simple calculator. Style inspired by Iphone's calculator app. Takes the number input from button clicks and voila, returns the result. There was such a huge taboo around using calculator growing up (Asian anyone?), I had my teacher twice when we were formally allowed to use a scientific calculator. I cherished mine for years. This is of course not as smart nor scientific as the CASIO one I had. 

The hardest part was building the logic to recall which operator was previously clicked between the two numbers so that the two numbers can be run through a calculation. 

Some theoretical ideas I entertained: 
- Can I capture and store whatever events take place after one operator is clicked until the next one is clicked? Like a bubble that is initiated by one event and terminated by another event?
- Can I ask the computer to wait for the next number to be input after an operator is clicked? What if I ask politely?

I didn't even know how to go about phrasing google search words to explore those ideas, and lying in bed after midnight looking down the imminent cliff of confusion, I had to keep telling myself, the simpler the better. Occum's razor. If it feels like overcomplication, it may just well be. 

After a couple of nights seeing minimal progress other than tweaking display functions, etc, the lightbulb finally went on. And it was a simple solution. Variables. 

It wasn't exactly 100% smooth sailing afterwards, but definitely gained momentum. 

For the future me, in case I ever decide to return for a version update, see if you can add the feature to allow keyboard input of numbers.
